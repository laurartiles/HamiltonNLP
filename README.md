To execute this R script and obtain the results explained in the pdf showing the rationale behind the work, you need to follow the next steps:
1. If the packages are not installed, please proceed to install them executing the first section of install.packages(...)
2. Load the libraries that will be used
3. In the script you will see different sections divided by headings 
  ################ Heading 1 #################
  
  The sections are: 
  - The corpus: where the text is created and encoded in UTF-8. Here we have a first look at the text.
  - Check encoding: where we check the encoding 
  - Cleaning data: the text is normalized (applying different functions) 
  - Number of occurrences: we analyse the frequency of some words 
  - Tokenize
  - POS-spacyr and POS-udpipe. Important! To use spacyr you need to have a python enviroment install and initialized. 
  - Word CLouds
  - BPE Model

In order to obtain the results, you just need to execute in order all the steps in the script.
